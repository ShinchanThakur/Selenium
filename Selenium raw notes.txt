Selenium -> Allows to automate human interaction with web pages
TestNG -> Allows to write tests/assertions
google.guava -> helps to work with tables

Selenium things
WebDriver
WebElement

Few classes -> good practices
DriverFactory -> produce and provide driver
Pages -> Links to open different pages

Few prebuilt classes provided by selenium
Actions -> helps to perform advanced actions using driver -> example -> we can right click using the contextClick(), but the contextMenu is a functionality of the browser, not the web page, so we won't be able to click anything in it using selenium
Select -> Helps to select things from a dropdown using various parameters
Alert -> to handle alerts/popups

*Since file selector (the explorer that allows us to select a particular file from our local machine) is part of the OS, and not selenium, therefore, we can't automate it using selenium. We will have to provide full path of the file, that we want to select.



Java things
var keyword -> used to specify any time of variable

Java helpful classes
Files -> can be used to create temporary files to upload in file selectors
Path -> can be used to store path and get absolute path of files -> can be used to delete files on exit too.
